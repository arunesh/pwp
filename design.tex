\section{Overall Design}

The Picolo database network is a collection of Picolo Nodes or Cluster of nodes.

A Node represents an instance of a participant in the network. A single machine
can host multiple nodes. A node consists of a fully-vertically integrated layer of network and database functionalities.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overall Picolo architecture.
        	Bottom up architecture - network sub system, database sub system. Verifiable logs. Data poisoning detection.
        \item Token economics.
        	Nodes need to put up a stake. Nodes earn tokens paid by dapps or developers who use the network. Who pays for the bandwidth.Options are mining or push the cost to developers
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Components}

\subsection{Participants}
There are four types of actors in the network:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Storage providers
	\item Storage consumers
	\item Data providers
	\item Data consumers \newline
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Storage providers}: These are akin to the miners in bitcoin or ethereum.
\newline\newline
\textbf{Storage consumers}: \DJ app developers
\newline\newline
\textbf{Data providers}: These are people with useful data to share.
\newline\newline
\textbf{Data consumers}: These are people interested in data shared by data providers.
