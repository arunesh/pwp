\section{Overall Design}

The Picolo database network is a collection of Picolo Nodes or Cluster of nodes.

A Node represents an instance of a participant in the network. A single machine
can host multiple nodes. A node consists of a fully-vertically integrated layer of network and database functionalities.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overall Picolo architecture.
        	Bottom up architecture - network sub system, database sub system. Verifiable logs. Data poisoning detection.
        \item Token economics.
        	Nodes need to put up a stake. Nodes earn tokens paid by dapps or developers who use the network. Who pays for the bandwidth.Options are mining or push the cost to developers
    \end{itemize}
