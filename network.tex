\section{Network Subsystem} 

The network layer is an overlay among the nodes participating in the Picolo database network. Specifically, its a peer-peer overlay network
on top of the Internal Protocol (IP). The peer-to-peer overlay routing infrastructure offers efficient, scalable, location-independent
routing of messages directly to nearby copies of an object or service using only localized resources [TP].

-- Self-repairing.
-- Soft-state based routing.

\subsection{Consistent Hashing} 

In Picolo, we use consistent hashing as a basic mechanism to distribute, replicate and locate content on the network.
Typical hashing based schemes do a good job of spreading load through a known, fixed collection of servers. Since the
Blockchain consists of nodes on the Internet which can appear and disappear based on incentives and other criteria, our
assumption is that machines come and go as they crash or are brought into the network. Also,
the information about what nodes are functional propagates slowly through the
network, so that clients may have incompatible “views” of which nodes are available to replicate data. (Note that a
node can also be a client). This makes standard hashing useless since it relies on clients agreeing on which nodes are responsible for serving a particular
page.

%For example, Feeley et al [3] implement a distributed global shared memory system for a network of workstations
%that uses a hash table distributed among the machines to resolve references. Each time a new machine joins the network,
%the require a central server to redistribute a completely updated hash table to all the machines.  Consistent hashing
%may help solve such problems.

Like most hashing schemes, consistent hashing assigns a set of items to buckets so that
each bin receives roughly the same number of items.  Unlike standard hashing schemes, a small change in the bucket set
does not induce a total remapping of items to buckets. In addition, hashing items into slightly different sets of
buckets gives only slightly different assignments of items to buckets.
